## Restaurants and Bars
### Traditional
- [Roter Ochse](https://www.facebook.com/roter.ochse.sesslach), Sesslach: Probably the most traditional restaurant I can recommend! Located in the historic town of Sesslach, they have a nice beer garden where you should have a beer next to traditional Franconian meals like Schäufele or various Bräten. 
- [Prinzengarten](https://www.facebook.com/prinzengartencoburg/), Josiasgarten: Perfect Biergarten for relaxed afterwork beers and regional dishes!
- [Gasthof zur Sonne](https://www.pension-zursonne.de/), Roth am Forst: A classic, especially on Sundays!
- [Gasthaus Langert](https://www.gasthaus-langert.de/b%C3%BCfett.php), Grub am Forst: Traditional Wirtshaus with a delicious selection of Bräten. Also check out their seasonal buffets, including aspargus season, Schnitzel, Braten or Fish. 
- [Schlosshotel](https://www.schlosshotel-hohenstein.de/restaurant/), Hohenstein: The restaurant, located in Schlosshotel Hohenstein, offers regional menus with a fine interpretation.
- [Gasthof Geuss](https://gastro.bad-staffelstein.de/de/gastro/detail/56a72e2e975a9ac054526a45), Altenbanz: Seemingly unimpressive in their Gaststuben, this Wirtshaus offers excellent Beef Steaks and Cordon Bleus. Would recommend for dinner.
- [Gasthof Müller](http://www.gasthof-mueller.de/index.html), Altenbanz: Very good address for Franconian Bräten for lunch on Sunday!
